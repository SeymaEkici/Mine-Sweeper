Here are the algorithms for each step of the Minesweeper game in Java:

1- User Input and Board Initialization

- Create a Scanner object to read input from the user
- Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the board
- Initialize the board as a 2D array of integers with all elements set to 0
- Calculate the number of mines to be placed on the board as numberOfElements / 4
- Create a second 2D array of booleans to keep track of the mine locations
- Use a loop to randomly place the mines on the board by setting the corresponding elements in the second array to true
- Print out the initial state of the board with all elements hidden ("-")

2- Game Loop

- Use a while loop to repeat the game until the user either wins or loses
- Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter a row and column to uncover a square
- Check if the entered row and column are within the bounds of the board, and prompt the user to re-enter if they are not
- Check if the selected square contains a mine. If it does, print "Game Over!" and exit the loop
- If the selected square does not contain a mine, count the number of mines in its neighboring squares and set its value to that count
- If the selected square is blank (contains no mines in its neighboring squares), recursively uncover all adjacent squares that are also blank or contain a non-mine value
- If all squares on the board except for the mines have been uncovered, print "You Win!" and exit the loop

3- Helper Functions

- A function to count the number of mines in the neighboring squares of a given square
- A function to recursively uncover all adjacent blank squares and non-mine values
